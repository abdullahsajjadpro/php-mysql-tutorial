/**
 * Differnce In Single And Double Quotes:-
 *  - Single Quotes:-
 *      - Single Quotes are generaly faster, and everything quotes inside it is treated as plain text
 *        and we cannot call variables in single quotes, for calling we have to use concatination.
 *  - Double Quotes:-
 *      - Double Quotes allow to use \n, \r, and \t, and variables inside it. An important point
 *        here is that you can use curly braces to isolate the name of the variable you want to
 *        evaluate.
